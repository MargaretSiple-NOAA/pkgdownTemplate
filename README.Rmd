# pkgdown template <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" style="padding: 10px"/>

This is a template for a NMFS branded GitHub repository, R package, and pkgdown website. It will have a NMFS palette, appropriate license and disclaimer, and a NMFS footer with logo.

The instructions will use the **usethis** and **pkgdown** packages. So install those.

## Step 1 Make sure the package builds

1. Clone this GitHub repository and then open the new repository (on your computer).
2. Set-up your RStudio project to use Roxygen for documentation and NAMESPACE
  * Tools > Project Options... > Build Tools  Click the checkbox that says "Build documentation with Roxygen".
  * The Configure popup box for Roxygen will probably appear, if not click the Configure button. Check all the checkboxes.
3. On the Build tab, click Install and Restart to make sure it builds.
4. On the Build tab, click Check to make sure it passes all the checks.
5. Type the code `pkgdown::build_site()` and make sure the **pkgdown** building works.

Note steps 3 and 4 are to make sure your computer is set up to build and check packages. As long as you haven't editted the package yet, it will build and pass check.

## Step 2 Customize your package

1. Edit the DESCRIPTION file (change Title, Description, urls for repo, Authors)
2. Add any required packages to Depends (or Imports* or Suggests*).
3. Edit the Readme.Rmd file.
4. Add your functions to the R folder. There are some template functions there already.
5. Don't touch the man folder. Roxygen2 will make your Rd files.

## Step 3 Make some vignettes (optional)

Vignettes are longform examples and are Rmd files in the `vignettes` folder. Easiest way to start a new vignette is `usethis::use_vignette("vignettename")`.

## Step 4 Customize your **pkgdown** site and build

pkgdown::build_favicon

<!-- Do not edit below. This adds the Disclaimer and NMFS footer. -->

```{r add-disclaimer, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/master/Disclaimer.md"
childtext <- readLines(url)
cat(childtext, sep="\n")
```

```{r footer, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfs-fish-tools/Resources/master/footer.md" 
childtext <- readLines(url)
cat(childtext, sep="\n")
```
